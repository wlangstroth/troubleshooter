# troubleshooter

A fun exercise in "diagnosis". It even has an old-school command-line interface
that asks you what your problem is.

## The Tree

If you check out the very brief source code, you can probably see how to shape
this idea to your purposes. The parameters `*trouble-tree*` and
`*node-contents*` are the whole thing. The numbers in the tree correspond to the
index numbers in `*node-contents*`. You just shape the tree to match the
messages, and you can solve every problem evar.

Evar.
